// this is a python script to generate airfoil mesh 
// It needs numpy and math database, which can be install by
// sudo apt-get install python-numpy 
// and math usually has been installed in default
// Just download the airfoil datas from Internet and save it as .dat files
// copy this script then save .dat and script in the same dir
// The "system"'s parent dir is best 
// replace the "airfoilfile" in script(in line 21) and run it
// Then the blockMeshDict will be overwrite, with the airfoilmesh you need .
// Finally, just blockMesh to generate it
