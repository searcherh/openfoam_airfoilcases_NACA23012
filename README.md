# openfoam_airfoilcases_NACA23012
A simple airfoil case in 2022_10
This is my first case completely finished by myself.
The airfoil is NACA23012 using simpleFoam solver. 
The case is copied from openfoam_tutorials_airFoil2D but the way to generate mesh is modified. 
I use curiosityFluidsAirfoilMesher.py , which can be found in github.
The other parts are common, you can change on your ways.
